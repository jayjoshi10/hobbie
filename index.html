            My favourite hobby is Badminton . It is a sport for two or four( "singles" or "doubles") people. The game is either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net but if it goes too far it will be an out.

The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back properly before it hits the floor. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point. They also get to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game.

The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets.

            <p> Badminton is one of the most played games in our country. In our school, there is a sports period in which teachers make students play badminton and tell them the benefits of playing it. </p>

            <p> We can play it easily because no much people required for it. First of all I run 10 rounds of the badminton court then do some streching exercises. After completing it I play Badminton I enjoy it too much. Then after finishing it I again do some cool down. </p>
